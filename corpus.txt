Algebraic Geometry: $D$-local algebraic fundamental groups of germs of normal complex  analytic singularities:
 In this paper, the notion of local algebraic fundamental groups of normal
complex analytic singularities are generalized to certain profinite groups
called $D$-local algebraic fundamental groups which turns out to be useful even
for the study of usual local algebraic fundamental groups and the Lefshetz type
theorem for $D$-local algebraic fundamental groups is proved under certain
conditions. The theorem yields, for example, the finiteness of the local
algebraic fundamental groups of a certain class of four dimensional
singularities and will be useful for the classification of three dimensional
purely log terminal singularities.
 
Algebraic Geometry: $F$-injectivity and Frobenius closure of ideals in Noetherian rings of  characteristic $p>0$:
 The main aim of this article is to study the relation between $F$-injective
singularity and the Frobenius closure of parameter ideals in Noetherian rings
of positive characteristic. The paper consists of the following themes,
including many other topics. We prove that if every parameter ideal of a
Noetherian local ring of prime characteristic $p>0$ is Frobenius closed, then
it is $F$-injective. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the
injectivity of the Frobenius action on $H^i_{\fm}(R)$ for all $i \le
f_{\fm}(R)$, where $f_{\fm}(R)$ is the finiteness dimension of $R$. As
applications, we prove the following results. (a) If the ring is $F$-injective,
then every ideal generated by a filter regular sequence, whose length is equal
to the finiteness dimension of the ring, is Frobenius closed. It is a
generalization of a recent result of Ma and which is stated for generalized
Cohen-Macaulay local rings. (b) Let $(R,\fm,k)$ be a generalized Cohen-Macaulay
ring of characteristic $p>0$. If the Frobenius action is injective on the local
cohomology $H_{\fm}^i(R)$ for all $i < \dim R$, then $R$ is Buchsbaum. This
gives an answer to a question of Takagi. We consider the problem when the union
of two $F$-injective closed subschemes of a Noetherian $\mathbb{F}_p$-scheme is
$F$-injective. Using this idea, we construct an $F$-injective local ring $R$
such that $R$ has a parameter ideal that is not Frobenius closed. This result
adds a new member to the family of $F$-singularities. We give the first
ideal-theoretic characterization of $F$-injectivity in terms the Frobenius
closure and the limit closure. We also give an answer to the question about
when the Frobenius action on the top local cohomology is injective.
 
Algebraic Geometry: $G$-Frobenius Manifolds:
 The goal of this paper is to introduce the notion of $G$-Frobenius manifolds
for any finite group $G$. This work is motivated by the fact that any
$G$-Frobenius algebra yields an ordinary Frobenius algebra by taking its
$G$-invariants. We generalize this on the level of Frobenius manifolds.
To define a $G$-Frobenius manifold as a braided-commutative generalization of
the ordinary commutative Frobenius manifold, we develop the theory of
$G$-braided spaces. These are defined as $G$-graded $G$-modules with certain
braided-commutative "rings of functions", generalizing the commutative rings of
power series on ordinary vector spaces.
As the genus zero part of any ordinary cohomological field theory of
Kontsevich-Manin contains a Frobenius manifold, we show that any
$G$-cohomological field theory defined by Jarvis-Kaufmann-Kimura contains a
$G$-Frobenius manifold up to a rescaling of its metric.
Finally, we specialize to the case of $G = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ and prove
the structure theorem for (pre-)$\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-Frobenius manifolds.
We also construct an example of a $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-Frobenius manifold
using this theorem, that arises in singularity theory in the hypothetical
context of orbifolding.
 
Algebraic Geometry: $J$-invariant of hermitian forms over quadratic extensions:
 We develop the version of the $J$-invariant for hermitian forms over
quadratic extensions in a similar way Alexander Vishik did it for quadratic
forms. This discrete invariant contains informations about rationality of
algebraic cycles on the maximal unitary grassmannian associated with a hermitan
form over a quadratic extension. The computation of the canonical $2$-dimension
of this grassmannian in terms of the $J$-invariant is provided, as well as a
complete motivic decomposition.
 
Algebraic Geometry: $L^2$-sheaves of holomorphic functions and $n$-forms on complex spaces  with isolated singularities:
 Let $X$ be a Hermitian complex space of pure dimension $n$ with isolated
singularities. In the present paper, we give a natural resolution for the
canonical sheaf of square-integrable holomorphic $n$-forms with Dirichlet
boundary condition on $X$. As application, we obtain an explicit smooth model
for the $L^2$-$\bar{\partial}$-cohomology, including natural resolutions for
sheaves of $\bar{\partial}$-closed (holomorphic) $L^2$-functions.
 
Algebraic Geometry: $\mathbb{A}^1$ curves on log K3 surfaces:
 In this paper, we study $\mathbb{A}^1$ curves on log K3 surfaces. We classify
all genuine log K3 surfaces of type II which admits countably infinite
$\mathbb{A}^1$ curves.
 
Algebraic Geometry: $\mathbb{F}_p$-expressible subalgebras and orbits of  $\mathbb{E}(r,\mathfrak{g})$:
 For $G$ a connected, reductive group over an algebraically closed field $k$
of large characteristic, we use the canonical Springer isomorphism between the
nilpotent variety of $\mathfrak{g}:=\mathrm{Lie}(G)$ and the unipotent variety
of $G$ to study the projective variety of elementary subalgebras of rank $r$,
denoted $\mathbb{E}(r,\mathfrak{g})$. In the case that $G$ is defined over
$\mathbb{F}_p$, we define the category of $\mathbb{F}_p$-expressible
subalgebras of $\mathfrak{g}$, and prove that this category is isomorphic to
Quillen's category of elementary abelian subgroups of the finite Chevalley
group $G(\mathbb{F}_p)$. This isomorphism of categories leads to a
correspondence between $G$-orbits of $\mathbb{E}(r,\mathfrak{g})$ defined over
$\mathbb{F}_p$ and $G$-conjugacy classes of elementary abelian subgroups of
rank $r$ in $G(\mathbb{F}_p)$. We use Magma to compute examples for
$G=\mathrm{GL}_n$, $n\le 5$.
 
Algebraic Geometry: $\mathbb{K}$-uniruled sets in affine geometry:
 The main goal of this thesis is to study $\mathbb{K}$-uniruled sets that
appear in affine geometry. At the beginning we discuss the property of
$\mathbb{K}$-uniruledness and its equivalent conditions. Then we bound from
above the degree of $\mathbb{K}$-uniruledness of the non-properness set of a
polynomial map in terms of its degree and degree of $\mathbb{K}$-uniruledness
of the domain variety. At the end we show that some sets associated with the
set of fixed points of an algebraic group action are $\mathbb{K}$-uniruled.

We evaluate two methods of applying BPE:
learning two independent encodings, one for the
source, one for the target vocabulary, or learning
the encoding on the union of the two vocabular-
ies (which we call joint BPE).4 The former has the
advantage of being more compact in terms of text
and vocabulary size, and having stronger guaran-
tees that each subword unit has been seen in the
training text of the respective language, whereas
the latter improves consistency between the source
and the target segmentation. If we apply BPE in-
dependently, the same name may be segmented
differently in the two languages, which makes it
harder for the neural models to learn a mapping
between the subword units. To increase the con-
sistency between English and Russian segmenta-
tion despite the differing alphabets, we transliter-
ate the Russian vocabulary into Latin characters
with ISO-9 to learn the joint BPE encoding, then
transliterate the BPE merge operations back into
Cyrillic to apply them to the Russian training text.5

THE WORST BIRTHDAY 

Not for the first time, an argument had broken out 
over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive. Mr. 
Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of 
the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew 
Harry’s room. 

“Third time this week!” he roared across the table. “If 
you can’t control that owl, it’ll have to go!” 

Harry tried, yet again, to explain. 

“She’s bored,” he said. “She’s used to flying around 
outside. If I could just let her out at night — ” 

“Do I look stupid?” snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of 
fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache. “I know 
what 11 happen if that owl’s let out.” 

He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia. 

Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned 
by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys’ son, Dudley.

“I want more bacon.” 



“There’s more in the frying pan, sweetums,” said Aunt 
Petunia, turning misty eyes on her massive son. “We 
must build you up while we’ve got the chance. ... I 
don’t like the sound of that school food. ...” 

“Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when / was 
at Smeltings,” said Uncle Vernon heartily. “Dudley 
gets enough, don’t you, son?” 

Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over 
either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to 
Harry. 

“Pass the frying pan.” 

“You’ve forgotten the magic word,” said Harry 
irritably. 

The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the 
family was incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his 
chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. 
Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands 
to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins 
throbbing in his temples. 

“I meant ‘please’!” said Harry quickly. “I didn’t mean 



“WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,” thundered his uncle, 
spraying spit over the table, “ABOUT SAYING THE ‘M’ 
WORD IN OUR HOUSE?” 

“But I — ” 

“HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!” roared 
Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist. 



Page | 3 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




“I just — ” 



“I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION 
OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!” 

Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale 
aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet. 

“All right,” said Harry, “all right ...” 

Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded 
rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the 
corners of his small, sharp eyes. 

Ever since Harry had come home for the summer 
holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a 
bomb that might go off at any moment, because Harry 
Potter wasn’t a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he 
was as not normal as it is possible to be. 

Harry Potter was a wizard — a wizard fresh from his 
first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and 
Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have 
him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how 
Harry felt. 

He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a 
constant stomachache. He missed the castle, with its 
secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though 
perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail 
arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, 
sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, 
visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to 
the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, 
Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding 
world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and 
fourteen players on broomsticks). 



Page | 4 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




All Harry’s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and 
top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had 
been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle 
Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did 
the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House 
Quidditch team because he hadn’t practiced all 
summer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went 
back to school without any of his homework done? 

The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a 
drop of magical blood in their veins), and as far as 
they were concerned, having a wizard in the family 
was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had 
even padlocked Harry’s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, 
to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the 
wizarding world. 

Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle 
Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous 
black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and 
bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on 
the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant 
green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. 
He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a 
thin, lightning-shaped scar. 

It was this scar that made Harry so particularly 
unusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only 
hint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of the reason he 
had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years 
before. 

At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow 
survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all 
time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and 
wizards still feared to speak. Harry’s parents had died 
in Voldemort’s attack, but Harry had escaped with his 
lightning scar, and somehow — nobody understood 
why — Voldemort’s powers had been destroyed the 
instant he had failed to kill Harry.

So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother’s 
sister and her husband. He had spent ten years with 
the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept 
making odd things happen without meaning to, 
believing the Dursleys’ story that he had got his scar 
in the car crash that had killed his parents. 

And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to 
Harry, and the whole story had come out. Harry had 
taken up his place at wizard school, where he and his 
scar were famous . . . but now the school year was 
over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the 
summer, back to being treated like a dog that had 
rolled in something smelly. 

The Dursleys hadn’t even remembered that today 
happened to be Harry’s twelfth birthday. Of course, 
his hopes hadn’t been high; they’d never given him a 
real present, let alone a cake — but to ignore it 
completely ... 

At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat 
importantly and said, “Now, as we all know, today is a 
very important day.” 

Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it. 

“This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of 
my career,” said Uncle Vernon. 

Harry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought 
bitterly, Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid 
dinner party. He’d been talking of nothing else for two 
weeks. Some rich builder and his wife were coming to 
dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge 
order from him (Uncle Vernon’s company made drills).

“I think we should run through the schedule one 
more time,” said Uncle Vernon. “We should all be in 
position at eight o’clock. Petunia, you will be — ?” 

“In the lounge,” said Aunt Petunia promptly, “waiting 
to welcome them graciously to our home.” 

“Good, good. And Dudley?” 

“I’ll be waiting to open the door.” Dudley put on a 
foul, simpering smile. “May I take your coats, Mr. and 
Mrs. Mason?” 

“They’ll love him!” cried Aunt Petunia rapturously. 

“Excellent, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon. Then he 
rounded on Harry. “And you?” 

“I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and 
pretending I’m not there,” said Harry tonelessly. 

“Exactly,” said Uncle Vernon nastily. “I will lead them 
into the lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour 
them drinks. At eight-fifteen — ” 

“I’ll announce dinner,” said Aunt Petunia. 

“And, Dudley, you 11 say — ” 

“May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. 
Mason?” said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an 
invisible woman. 

“My perfect little gentleman!” sniffed Aunt Petunia. 

“And you?” said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry. 

“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending 
I’m not there,” said Harry dully. 

Page | 7 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




“Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good 
compliments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?” 



“Vernon tells me you’re a wonderful golfer, Mr. 

Mason. ... Do tell me where you bought your dress, 
Mrs. Mason. ...” 

“Perfect ... Dudley?” 

“How about — ‘We had to write an essay about our 
hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.’ ” 

This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. 
Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, 
while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn’t 
see him laughing. 

“And you, boy?” 

Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged. 

“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending 
I’m not there,” he said. 

“Too right, you will,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. 

“The Masons don’t know anything about you and it’s 
going to stay that way. When dinner’s over, you take 
Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, 
and I’ll bring the subject around to drills. With any 
luck, I’ll have the deal signed and sealed before the 
news at ten. We’ll be shopping for a vacation home in 
Majorca this time tomorrow.” 

Harry couldn’t feel too excited about this. He didn’t 
think the Dursleys would like him any better in 
Majorca than they did on Privet Drive. 

“Right — I’m off into town to pick up the dinner 
jackets for Dudley and me. And you,” he snarled at 

Page | 8 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




Harry. “You stay out of your aunt’s way while she’s 
cleaning.” 

Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, 
sunny day. He crossed the lawn, slumped down on 
the garden bench, and sang under his breath: 

“Happy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me ...” 

No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the 
evening pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably 
into the hedge. He had never felt so lonely. More than 
anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing 
Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron 
Weasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn’t 
seem to be missing him at all. Neither of them had 
written to him all summer, even though Ron had said 
he was going to ask Harry to come and stay. 

Countless times, Harry had been on the point of 
unlocking Hedwig’s cage by magic and sending her to 
Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn’t worth 
the risk. Underage wizards weren’t allowed to use 
magic outside of school. Harry hadn’t told the 
Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he 
might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped 
them from locking him in the cupboard under the 
stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first 
couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering 
nonsense words under his breath and watching 
Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs 
would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and 
Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the 
magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its 
appeal — and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten 
his birthday. 

What wouldn’t he give now for a message from 
Hogwarts? From any witch or wizard? He’d almost be 

Page | 9 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to 
be sure it hadn’t all been a dream. ... 

Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At 
the very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face 
with none other than Lord Voldemort himself. 
Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he 
was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to 
regain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort’s 
clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow 
escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking 
in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where 
Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his 
wide, mad eyes — 

Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. 
He had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge 
— and the hedge was staring back. Two enormous 
green eyes had appeared among the leaves. 

Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated 
across the lawn. 

“I know what day it is,” sang Dudley, waddling toward 
him. 

The huge eyes blinked and vanished. 

“What?” said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot 
where they had been. 

“I know what day it is,” Dudley repeated, coming right 
up to him. 

“Well done,” said Harry. “So you’ve finally learned the 
days of the week.”
